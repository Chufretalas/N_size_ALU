# N Size ALU

This project defines a variable sized ALU with a board implementation designed for the [Nandland Go Board](https://nandland.com/the-go-board/).

I was inspired to do this project while attending an introductory computer architecture class taught by my professor Rodrigo Izidoro Tinini. I based myself heavily on the material provided on class to design the actual ALU, material which based itself on the work from another professor, Emilio Francesquini, and on the book [Computer Organization And Design: The Hardware/Software Interface, 5th Edition](https://booksite.elsevier.com/9780124077263/).

The other source that made this project possible is the wonderful work of Russell Merrick from nandland.com. Everything FPGA related that I applied in this project, I learned from his book, website articles and youtube videos.
